# simple_nn

#### A highly generic and easy to use C++ library for feed-forward neural networks.

### Authors

- Author/Maintainer: Konstantinos Chatzilygeroudis

### Using the code

This is a header-only library and you should just include the header files in your project.

#### Installing using the waf build system

- `./waf configure --prefix=INSTALL_DIR`
- `[sudo] ./waf install` (you might need sudo depending on your installation directory)

#### Compiling the examples

- `./waf configure`
- `./waf`

After a successful build, the executables should be inside the `build` folder. The examples are mainly here for the user to inspect the code and do not provide any meaningful output.
